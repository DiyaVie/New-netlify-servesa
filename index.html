  "Dear DIYA Woman, you didn’t come this far to stop now. Your goals are still valid. Your dreams still matter. Keep showing up even when no one’s clapping yet.",
  "Some days will test you. Things might not go as planned. Breathe, regroup, and remember: you’ve overcome so much already.",
  "Repeat after me: I am capable. I am worthy. I am becoming. Speak life over yourself; your words carry power.",
  "Comparison steals joy. Your journey is yours alone. Celebrate wins without questioning yours. There’s room for all to shine.",
  "Dear DIYA Woman, it’s okay to rest. Hustling non-stop doesn’t prove anything. Protect your peace and recharge.",

  "Celebrate the silent wins: getting out of bed when you didn’t want to, sending that email, choosing yourself. Small steps matter.",
  "Dear DIYA Woman, surround yourself with those who remind you of your power. Find your tribe that pushes you to dream bigger.",

  "Don’t wait for the perfect moment; create it. Perfection is a myth—progress is what counts.",
  "Your voice and story matter. Don’t shrink yourself to fit into spaces that can’t hold your greatness.",
  "Rest if you must, but never quit. There’s a version of you on the other side of this grind that will thank you.",
  "Not every day will feel productive—and that’s okay. Your worth isn’t measured by output.",
  "Sis, be proud of your quiet evolution. Your growth is undeniable, even if others don’t see it.",
  "Protect your energy. Not everyone deserves access to you. Prioritize peace over people-pleasing.",

  "Imagine how proud your younger self would be seeing you now. Don’t lose sight of your journey.",
  "Your pace is perfect. Stop rushing and doubting. What’s meant for you is on its way.",
  "Stay humble but know your worth. There’s nothing wrong with being proud of your hard work.",
  "Some may not understand your journey—and that’s okay. It’s your vision, not theirs. Keep building.",
  "You are the bag. Secure yourself first, then go get everything you deserve. Queens never settle.",

  "Every delay is not a denial. Trust the timing of your journey.",
  "Take moments to celebrate how far you’ve come. Progress deserves applause.",
